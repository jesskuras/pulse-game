![Hextra Feature Graphic](assets/icon/feature_graphic.png)

**Connect with your intuition. Master the grid.**

Hextra is a daily logic puzzle that blends strategy, memory, and a sixth sense. Every day, a new hexagonal web is generated with a single hidden goal: the Heart. Your mission is to find it using as few scans as possible.

## 📡 How to Play

1.  **Scan**: Tap any node to send a "Pulse."
2.  **Triangulate**: The number revealed is your SHORTEST PATH distance to the hidden Heart.
3.  **Survive**: Navigate around broken paths and signal dampeners to zero in on the target.
