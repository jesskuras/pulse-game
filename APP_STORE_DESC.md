**Connect with your intuition. Master the grid.**

Hextra is a daily logic puzzle that blends strategy, memory, and a sixth sense. Every day, a new hexagonal web is generated with a single hidden goal: the Heart. Your mission is to find it using as few scans as possible.

**📡 HOW IT WORKS**
Tap any node to send a "Pulse." The network reveals how far you are from the target—but not the direction. 
*   **3** means you are 3 hops away.
*   **1** means you're right next to it.
*   Triangulate the signal to zero in on the solution.

**⚠️ NAVIGATE THE OBSTACLES**
The grid isn't just empty space. Watch out for:
*   **Ruptures**: Broken links that block your path.
*   **Signal Dampeners**: Heavy zones that distort distance.
*   **Static Interference**: Glitched nodes that give fuzzy, unreliable data.
*   **Fading Signals**: Clues that vanish after 3 seconds—test your memory!

**📊 TRACK YOUR STATS**
Every scan analyzes your performance:
*   **Logic**: Did you triangulate efficiently?
*   **Luck**: Did you beat the odds?
*   **Speed**: How fast is your mind?
Share your daily "Hextra" card with friends and compare your scores.
