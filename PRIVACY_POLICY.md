# Privacy Policy for Hextra

**Last updated: February 16, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you use the **Hextra** mobile application (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect

### Personal Information
**Hextra** does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal information to external servers.

### Device Data
The App may access your device's clipboard or storage solely for the purpose of the "Share" feature (sharing your daily results image), which is initiated explicitly by you. This data remains on your device and is not collected by the developer.

## 2. Local Storage

The App uses your device's local storage (Shared Preferences) to save your game progress, daily statistics, and settings (e.g., tutorial completion status). This data is stored locally on your device and is not accessible to the developer or third parties.

## 3. Third-Party Links

The App contains a link to a third-party website (Ko-fi) for voluntary support. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## 4. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
